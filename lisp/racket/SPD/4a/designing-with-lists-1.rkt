;; PROBLEM:
;;
;; You've been asked to design a program having to do with all the owls
;; in the owlery.
;;
;; (A) Design a data definition to represent the weights of all the owls.
;;     For this problem call it ListOfNumber.
;; (B) Design a function that consumes the weights of owls and produces
;;     the total weight of all the owls.
;; (C) Design a function that consumes the weights of owls and produces
;;     the total number of owls.


;; Data definitions:

;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. each number in the list is an owl weight in ounces
(define LON1 empty)
(define LON2 (cons 60 (cons 42 empty)))

(define (fn-for-lon lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first lon)
              (fn-for-lon (rest lon)))]))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: empty
;;  - compound: (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;;  - self-reference: (rest lon) is ListOfNumber


;; Functions:

;; ListOfNumber -> Number
;; produce sum of weights of owls in lon
(check-expect (sum empty) 0)
(check-expect (sum (cons 60 empty)) 60)
(check-expect (sum (cons 60 (cons 42 empty))) (+ 60 42))

;(define (sum lon) 0) ; stub

(define (sum lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (+ (first lon)
            (sum (rest lon)))]))

;; ListOfNumber -> Natural
;; produce total number of weights in consumed list
(check-expect (count empty) 0)
(check-expect (count (cons 12 empty)) (+ 1 0))
(check-expect (count (cons 35 (cons 12 empty))) (+ 1 1 0))
