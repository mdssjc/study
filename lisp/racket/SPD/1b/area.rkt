;; PROBLEM:
;;
;; DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side
;; of a square and produces the area of the square.
;;
;; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
;;
;; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Number -> Number
;; Given length of one side of square, produce the area of the square
